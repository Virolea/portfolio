        Hi and Welcome to my website!
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Vincent Rolea and I'm a young French engineer. I graduated from Ecole Centrale de Lille
        in 2014, with a Double Degree in Aerospace Dynamics in conjunction with Cranfield University (UK).

        I've always been fascinated by new technologies, and I have started coding websites as a hobby back in 2011.
        Back then, I used PHP for my projects' back-end and had a first experience over a 4-month internship in a French
        Bank where I developed a management platform for Analysts from scratch.

        After a short experience as a simulation Engineer in one of the biggest French automotive company, I have decided to go back to web development, and did a 9-week bootcamp in Paris, at "Le Wagon". There I learnt a new language, Ruby as well as its dedicated framework Rails. I also discovered new ways to collaborate as a team and refined my workflow. During my stay at le Wagon, I co-developed Airscape.io, panorama-based sharing platform.

        Always looking for new technologies to learn, I started learning Apple's Swift language as soon as it got released, and started developing iOS apps using it.
      </p>

        I'm also a long-term musician and music aficionado, I started the piano at 5, and learnt guitar and drums by myself. I have been member of several music bands, playing Jazz, Rock and even Classical piece of music.
